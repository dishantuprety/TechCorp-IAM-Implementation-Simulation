# TechCorp-IAM-Implementation-Simulation
This repository contains my work for the Identity and Access Management (IAM) Implementation Simulation for TechCorp Enterprises. The project demonstrates how to design and plan an IAM platform that aligns with business objectives, enhances security, and streamlines operations.

The simulation includes:

-Assessment of TechCorpâ€™s existing systems and IAM maturity
-Detailed IAM solution design (User Lifecycle & Access Control)
-Implementation roadmap with milestones and resources
