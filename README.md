# TechCorp-IAM-Implementation-Simulation
This repository contains my work for the Identity and Access Management (IAM) Implementation Simulation for TechCorp Enterprises. The project demonstrates how to design and plan an IAM platform that aligns with business objectives, enhances security, and streamlines operations.

The simulation includes:

- Assessment of TechCorp’s existing systems and IAM maturity
- Detailed IAM solution design (User Lifecycle & Access Control)
- Implementation roadmap with milestones and resources
- Integration challenges and proposed solutions
- Testing, Go-Live, and Monitoring strategies
- Key learnings and business alignment

Project Structure

- [IAM Solution Design for TechCorp.pdf](IAM Solution Design for TechCorp.pdf)-Written report version of the plan.
- [Implementation Plan for TechCorp's.pdf](Implementation Plan for TechCorp's.pdf)-PowerPoint presentation with detailed implementation plan.

Implementation Roadmap (Summary)

- Assessment & Planning – Evaluate current state, identify gaps
- Design – Create IAM architecture, lifecycle automation, access control framework
- Implementation – Configure IAM platform, integrate with HR, cloud, and third-party apps
- Testing – Unit, integration, UAT, and security testing
- Go-Live – Phased rollout, training, and support readiness
- Monitoring & Continuous Improvement – Real-time monitoring, compliance, periodic reviews

Key Learnings

- IAM requires both technical design and business alignment
- Automation improves efficiency and reduces security risks
- Integration is the biggest challenge, especially with legacy systems
- Balancing security (MFA, RBAC) and user experience (SSO, self-service) is essential
- Continuous monitoring and governance sustain IAM effectiveness

Acknowledgment

This simulation has been an excellent opportunity to strengthen my knowledge of IAM and practice project planning, aligning technical solutions with business goals.
